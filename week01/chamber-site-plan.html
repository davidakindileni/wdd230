    <h4>Ile-Ife Chamber of Commerce</h4>

    <p>Ile-Ife (or Ifẹ̀ for short) is an ancient Yoruba city in south-western Nigeria. The city is located in
      present-day
      Osun State. Ife is about 218 kilometers northeast of Lagos with a population of over 500,000 people, which is the
      highest in Osun State according to population census of 2006. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%E1%BA%B9"

      The city is the ancestral home (or birth place) of the Yoruba race in South-west, Nigeria. The name represents the
      city itself wherein the chamber is located and operates.

      The Site Plan of a website is a map of the pages in a site and how they are related and
      linked together. From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 3 sub or child
      pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should be accessible from any other page, it is
      essentially showing us the global navigation for the site.

    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
      Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They show the major sections of content that will be on
      the page and the relative locations of each element.</p>

    <h4>Wireframe for mobile viewports</h4>
    <img class="mobile-view" src="./images/mobile-view-wireframe.png" alt="mobile view">

    <h4>Wireframe for larger viewports</h4>
